# final-project
In this project I broke down a data set on factors that impact student performance in school. The focus of this project was to see how specific economic factors impact student performance such as, family income, access to resources, and parental education. From my model and other visuals of the data I think that it is clear to see the diffenece in school preformance across economic factors.
