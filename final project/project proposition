1. I plan to work alone for this project
2. I plan on using this data set on Student Performance

Null hypothesis: In the student performance data set, Education of student's parents, their family income, or Resource Access will not have any influence on their perfromance
Alternative hypothesis: In the student performance data set we will see that the level of education of student's parents, their family income, and Resource Access will have an impact on their performance.
The model that I will use for this data set is most likely something that works well with continuous data, for example a Multiple Linear Regression model, or maybe random forest model.
